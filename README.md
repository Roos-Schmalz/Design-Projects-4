The code has been created purely for a 4th year uni design project. The report for this project has a strict page limit (including appendices), which is why I have uploaded the code.


The following book has been used for the method and equations:
P. C. Wankat, Separation process engineering: includes mass transfer analysis, London: Pearson, 2022. 

The following sources are used to get values for the properties of components involved:
